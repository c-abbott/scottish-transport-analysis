# Project 2 - Group plan

In your first meeting, discuss and record a quick note of your agreed answers to the following questions:

- When and how often will you meet as a group? Will you use Zoom, Teams, something else?
* We will 2-3 times per week to pair program with the expectation that we will meet more often nearer to the deadline 
* Our meetings (short) will ideally follow a SCRUM structure i.e. Yesterday I did XYZ, Today I will work on ABC and LMN are my blockers
* Teams will be used for communication
* Trello board will be used for project management (Kanban board scheme)

- How will you communicate outside of your meetings (email, Teams, Discord, group chat...)?
* Daily updates in SCRUM channel on Teams


- Is everyone comfortable with using git/GitHub? If not, one person could demonstrate for the group during your first meeting; if nobody is comfortable, ask on Piazza or email Charlotte!
* Yes


- Discuss your ideas for questions to investigate. Are there questions in the suggestions which you find interesting? Do you have new ideas of your own? You can keep a note of these ideas here.
* At least one interactive visualisation
* At lease one map visualisation either using geopandas or folium
* We plan on answering a total of 6 questions where 3/4 of these will be sampled from the examples given in the instructions and 2/3 will be our own ideas.
* Ideas/questions will be managed on Trello board
* Map of Scotland split up into local authorities. Number of roads managed will be used as scale
* At least one scatter plot with variable point sizes

- How do you want to divide the tasks? Are you planning to pair-program?
* Each question will be handled in pairs
* Most work will be completed in pair programming sessions


- Who will put together, proofread, and push the final notebook before the deadline? Will one person be responsible, will you have a final meeting together, or something else?
* A final meeting will be organised where we analyse our report notebook as if we were markers
* Appropriate changes will made in real-time with the expectation that the bulk of the code/markdown will be written 2/3 days prior to the deadline giving ample time for editing
